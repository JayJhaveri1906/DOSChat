# DOSChat 
* Real-time chat applications like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Snapchat were already dominating the market, but post COVID-19 pandemic as the social distancing and WFH are new normal, they have become a crucial and integral component to keep people connected professionally and personally both. 
* In an attempt to give a nostalgic retro feel to popular real-time chat apps, we have designed a MS DOS based real-time chat application called DOSChat.
